			<h2>1966: First Affiliates</h2>
			<p>The Vocational Education Clubs of America (VOECA) is formed by Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin. Articles of incorporation are filed with the Office Education Association (OEA) with these states as the first three affiliates. </p>

			<h1 id="Cult"> Our Traditions</h1>
			<h2>Traditions play a unique role in the culture of our organization by evoking a sense of pride among our members and serve as a way of connecting our current student members with our alumni after graduation.</h2>
			<p>Not only are traditions the things we hold most dear and that resonate the loudest within an organization, but traditions foster a great sense of community and offer excellent opportunities for new members to become involved and be included.
				The traditions of Business Professionals of America can teach not only our members, but those outside of the organization about our history and serve as a means for building community, instilling common values that span generations, and generate pride and enthusiasm.
				We invite you to share in these traditions and all the positive contributions they have to offer.</p>
